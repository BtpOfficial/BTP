**LearnHub**

LearnHub is an online learning platform developed using the MERN stack with a meticulously structured course hierarchy encompassing subjects,
units, and topics. The application focuses on integrating LLM technology and website development in the educational domain.
It uses sentence similarity to score students' descriptive answers, automating the evaluation process that was previously inefficient and
handled manually by teachers. Future versions aim to analyze student progress over time and suggest personalized learning paths for
students with automated content generation.
